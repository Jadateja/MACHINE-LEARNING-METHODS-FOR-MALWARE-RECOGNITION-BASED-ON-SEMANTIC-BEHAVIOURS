This project aims at detecting, whether the malware is present or not in file/system.
It involves the following steps;

1. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and is preprocessed using SMOTE by removing null values and duplicate values.
2.  The preprocessed data is examined using SVM(Support vector machine), CNN ( Convolutional neural network), Decision tree classifier and XGBooster.
3. The algorithm which gives highest accuracy is taken into training and remaining analysis is pushed into testing.
4. The model performance is done for the trained data and will yield result i.e. will tell whether a file/system is attacked by malware or not.
