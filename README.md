# MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS-FOR-MALWARE-RECOGNITION-BASED-ON-SEMANTIC-BEHAVIOURS
This project is to build a malware detection system that will provide an efficient way to detect the malware based on the activities it may perform on the computer it is being installed on.
Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing amajor security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Driven by the substantial profits behind cybercrimes, thenumber of new variants of malware has experienced unprecedented growth. Various malware hasbeen widely used for cyber-criminals to accomplish their evil intentions and goals. 

To combat the increasing amount and reduce the threat of malicious programs, a novel deep learning framework,which uses NLP techniques for reference, combines CNN and LSTM neurons to capture the locally spatial correlations and learn from sequential long-term dependency is proposed. The signature of the malware is defined by the task the malware performs when it gets activated in the machine,for example, running the Operating System services, downloading the infected files from the internet. The proposed algorithm detects the malware based on its Signature. 

Decision Trees, XGBoost and Support Vector Machines are proposed for the malware detection.
